# Welcome to In.

In is an iOS messanger app designed to create temporary and easily escapable group conversations. 

## In Gives Users an out
In is designed to give users freedom from constant notifications about group messages that they don't want to be a part of. Invited users can opt out of a conversation anytime with one quick motion, and conversation creators can destroy a conversation permanantly with the same ease.

## In Makes All Conversations Temporary
With a heavy focus on event planning, All of In's conversations are temporary. Users give their conversations an expiration date and time, and when the conversation expires, the conversation is forever erased, freeing up your phones and your minds for the next big event.

## In Uses Event Driven Database Querying
In's messaging system and content storage uses Firebase to asynchronously update the user's information, creating a seamless and responsive user experience.

## In talks directly to your phone
Written in swift, In is able to access your contacts directly, meaning you don't have to sort through and find your friends, they're already all there. If one of your contacts doesn't have the app, In will generate a text for them with a download link. You'll get them next time.
